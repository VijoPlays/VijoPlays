I'm Alexander 'Vijo' Ott, a Software Engineer.

I primarily work in the *Backend*, but I also enjoy doing Fullstack work.

I work on everything from the conception, to the development and improvement, up to the deployment of software.

# Programming languages

Over the years I've worked with many programming languages and I'm fine with using most of them, however I'd like to give a special mention to the following ones.

## Backend languages

* Python
* C#
* Java
* Go

I really enjoy writing smaller programs in Python, but anything bigger is usually reseved for Java/C#.

## Frontend languages

* React
* Vue
* TypeScript/JavaScript
